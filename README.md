Here a screenshot of 'Hope' in action ! I really love the style of Vanillaware games, you should play one if you haven't done it yet !

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff. To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

What do 'Hope' change ?
-------------------------------
I use (like all of you I think) a lot of time Google, and I got fed up with the current style : a bit too white and plain for my taste. That's why I decided to write a flat-inspired theme for Google Search :
- in the headbar, I placed the Google logo in the middle, changed the icons for the notification and apps buttons, the searchbar is now pure white (no more box-shadow) and changed at the same time the search icon. Add a 'Boards' button, even tho it's not a button, you'll just have to hover it to activate a sidebar with all the google sections (all/images/news/videos/shopping/more). Plus, added a colors bar at the top composed with the main colors of Google (a bit like Vimeo!) to fill the lack of colors of the page.
- in the content, like the google on android, there are a lot of white box with some light shadows to add a bit of dynamism, there are  a bit bigger in the Desktop version. I deleted a lot of stuff such as the footbar, google ads, feedback link, ectera. You'll find some colors border-top for some boxes (images box, related search box, ...) because again it'll be too white otherwise.

How to install it ?
-------------------------------
After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style', copy/paste the code in 'Hope.css', name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

* to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/rob…), 'Bebas Neue' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/beb…), 'Bokutachi no Gothic 2' (www.freejapanesefont.com/bokut…) and if you want Meiryo, all of them are free so don't be shy.
* download Adblock Plus to kill the ads.

Where can I find your works ?
-------------------------------
I have a deviantart page : nicknameisfortheweak.deviantart.com
I also submit my script in pastebin : http://pastebin.com/u/Catgrills

And that's it, I hope you'll enjoy this script if you see this submission ! Like usual, if you have find the script cool or bad, if you have questions, suggestions, there is a section called 'Comments', you can use it everytime !
