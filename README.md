Here a screenshot of 'Hope' in action !

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff (for example adds!). To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

How to install it ?
-------------------------------
After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style' and copy/paste the code in 'Hope.css', name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

* to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/rob…), 'Bebas Neue' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/beb…), 'Bokutachi no Gothic 2' (www.freejapanesefont.com/bokut…) and if you want Meiryo, all of them are free so don't be shy.
* download Adblock Plus to kill the ads.
